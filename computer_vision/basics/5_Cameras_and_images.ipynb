    "If size of the aperture is large - a lot of rays from the single point will pass through.\n",
    "If size of the aperture is small - diffraction effect takes place.\n",

    "## The Thin Lens Equation\n",
    "Using pairs of similar triangles it is possible to derive The Thin Lens Equation:\n",

    "## Depth of Field\n",
    "The aperture controls how much space in depth is in focus.\n",
    "If the aperture is <b>large</b> - very <b>small</b> movements of the object allowed to keep it in the focus.\n",
    "If the aperture is <b>small</b> - <b>large</b> movements of the object allowed to keep it in the focus\n",

    "## Filed Of View (FOV)\n",
    "FOV is the function of focal length. The larger focal length the smaller FOV and the bigger zoom.\n",
    "<img src=\"5_images/fov_and_focal_length.png\" width=\"1000\">\n",
    "Note: moving and zooming is not the same, we will get different perspective distortion:\n",
    "<img src=\"5_images/moving_vs_zooming.png\" width=\"1000\">\n",
    "Dolly zoom: increase FOV (decrease focal length) -> decrease zoom and move the camera closer. You will get the object of the same size but with different perspective distortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Typical problems\n",
    "1. Distortions:\n",
    "<img src=\"5_images/distortions.png\" width=\"1000\">\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Chromatic Aberration (light of different color goes through the lens differently\n",
    "3. Vignetting (for different point of picture different number of rays hit the medium)\n",
